# Train-Consist-Management-App
Drawback of UC2 Approach
In UC2, bogies are stored in a List. However, a List allows duplicate values, which is dangerous in a railway system.
For example, two bogies could accidentally be registered with the same ID:
BG101, BG101
This violates business rules and can cause inconsistent train formation.
To enforce uniqueness, we introduce the Set data structure.
